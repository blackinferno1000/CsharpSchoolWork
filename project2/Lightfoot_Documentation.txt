Assignment: Aquarium

Description: Program simulates a aquarium of random fish types and shows their info and total cost for everything.

User Responsibilities: User has no responsibilities but to run the program.

Caveats: Not sure if wanting consolecolor black for the "water" was a typo or not but mine is white so easy to see.
Sometimes the fish shapes are black due to colors being random and you can't see the fish.

Notes: N/A
